# Udacity_CNN_dogproject

This is the assignment in Udacity Deep Learning Course.
The following is what we can learn from this project:

1. Preprocess the data before training
2. Build the CNN model
3. Use the tranfer learning technique to decrease the training time.
4. Design the easy way to demonstrate the prediciton.

Program Instruction: 
Open the notebook with the jupyter notebook.
Follow the instrcutionS step by step.

The training result:
1. The scratch model of dog breed classifier: Only 15% accuraccy
2. The tranfer learning model of the VGG16 for dog breed classifier:
   78% accuraccy
